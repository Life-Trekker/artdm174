            <h1>Hi Y'all!</h1>
            <p>I'm Josh: a student, programmer and game dev. While I don't have a hyper specific career path in mind, 
                I love all things digital and would really like to work somewhere in the software industry. 
                My dream job is to design and program games full time. 
                Schoolwise, I plan to finish up my Game Design Associates and transfer to a 4-year university in Fall 2025.</p>
