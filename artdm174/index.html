            <h1>Hi Y'all!</h1>

            <p>I'm Josh: a student, programmer, web designer and game dev. While I don't have a hyper specific career path in mind, 
                I love all things digital and would really like to work somewhere in the software industry. 
                My dream job is to design and program games full time. 
                Schoolwise, I plan to finish up my Associates' in Game Design and transfer to a 4-year university in Fall 2025 
                to get my Bachelor's in Computer Science.

                    <p class="date">Sep. 20th</p>
                    <p>For this project, I created the page you're currently on.  
                        My jump page had to be version controlled using Git and GitHub.  
                        I created a remote repository and pushed all my files to it.
                        This project also had to include links and information about all my other assignments.

                    <p class="date">Aug. 29th</p>
                    <p>This lab required me to take a preexisting webpage for Bubacan Landscaping and recreate it.  
                        The goal was to get as close to the example layout as possible, 
                        and to refresh all the skills I had learned in my previous web design course.</p>
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Life-Trekker/artdm174/tree/main/artdm174/labs/lab1">Lab 1: CSS Layout with Flexbox and Grid</a>
                    <p class="date">Sep. 9th</p>
                    <p>Here, I was instructed to design a webpage using flexbox and CSS grid.  
                        The header had to have a logo and title beside each other with a nav bar below.  I used nested flexboxes to accomplish this.
                        The main portion of the page needed to have a 4 by 3 grid of images with the middle two cells containing text.
                        Our webpage also had to scale to different mobile widths.
                    </p>

                <li><a href="https://github.com/Life-Trekker/artdm174/tree/main/artdm174/labs/lab2">Lab 2: CSS Transitions and Animation</a>
                    <p class="date">Sep. 14th</p>
                    <p>For this third lab, the goal was to practice using the transition and @keyframe properties.
                        I created a UI page transition that eased viewers into my webpage.
                        I also implemented transitions for when the links on the nav bar were hovered over.
