                    <p>I'm a student, programmer, web designer, game dev and much more. While I don't have a hyper specific career path in mind, 
                        I love all things digital and want to work in the software industry. 
                        My dream is to design and program games full time. 
                        Schoolwise, I plan to finish up my Associates' in Game Design and transfer to a 4-year university in Fall 2025 
                        to get my Bachelor's in Computer Science.

                    <p>Sep. 20th</p>
                    <p>For this project, I created the page you're currently on.  
                        My jump page had to be version controlled using Git and GitHub.  
                        I created a remote repository and pushed all my files to it.
                        This project also had to include links and information about all my other assignments.

                    <p>Oct. 17th</p>
                    <p>Here I created a simple photo gallery for a fictional restaurant.  
                        The gallery can be changed with buttons or automatically after a couple seconds.
                        The caption below also changes with each image.

                    <p>Nov. 7th</p>
                    <p>The goal of Project 3 was to create a page with content that changes based on the media being played.
                        I chose to create a digital instruction book for the board game Carcassonne.
                        This rulebook will automatically flip to the page referenced by the How-To-Play video.

                    <p>Aug. 29th</p>
                    <p>This lab required me to take a preexisting webpage for Bubacan Landscaping and recreate it.  
                        The goal was to get as close to the example layout as possible, 
                        and to refresh all the skills I had learned in my previous web design course.</p>

                    <p>Sep. 9th</p>
                    <p>Here, I was instructed to design a webpage using flexbox and CSS grid.  
                        The header had to have a logo and title beside each other with a nav bar below.  I used nested flexboxes to accomplish this.
                        The main portion of the page needed to have a 4 by 3 grid of images with the middle two cells containing text.
                        Our webpage also had to scale to different mobile widths.

                    <p>Sep. 14th</p>
                    <p>For this third lab, the goal was to practice using the transition and @keyframe properties.
                        I created a UI page transition that eased viewers into my webpage.
                        I also implemented transitions for when the links on the nav bar were hovered over.
